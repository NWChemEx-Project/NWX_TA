# SotA Comparison

The NWChemEx Project has been asked to compare the code performance
against that of State of the Art codes. The State of the Art
codes we picked as reference point are:

| Code   | Capabilities        |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| Psi4   | canonical DFT       |
|        | density fitting DFT |
| MPQC   | DL-PNO CCSD         |
|        | DL-PNO CCSD(T)      |
| MOLPRO | DL-PNO CCSD         |
|        | DL-PNO CCSD(T)      |

In this directory we have collected sample inputs and outputs
to facilitate such performance comparison.
