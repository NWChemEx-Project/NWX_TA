# MOLPRO

This directory contains example inputs for the DL-PNO methods implemented
in MOLPRO. However, as we need to buy a license for MOLPRO before we
can actually execute these examples they are more like suggestions
rather than worked examples. You may find issues with these inputs
when you try to run them.
