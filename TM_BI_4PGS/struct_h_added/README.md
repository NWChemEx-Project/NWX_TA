# TM_BI_4PGS: Trans-Membrane Bax Inhibitor Protein 4PGS

Protein YetJ from Bacillus Subtilis at pH 6 [Chang:2014] as obtained from the
Protein Data Bank with structure ID [4PGS](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=4pgs).
The structure in this directory was obtained from PDBFixer as provided with
the Amber package, [AmberTools17](http://ambermd.org/). The run that
patched the structure is given in the script fix_pdb.sh.

Another structure (4pgr_ph8.pdb) was generated by using the structure,
experimentally obtained at pH 6, but protonating it at pH 8. This should be
the structure that lies at the start of the observed conformation change.

Interestingly, rerunning PDBFixer does not produce the same structures. Various
coordinates come out differently.
