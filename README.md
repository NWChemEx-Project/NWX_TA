# NWX_TA: NWChemEx - Testing and Assessment

This repository contains everything related to the testing and assessment part of NWChemEx. 
In particular it contains the test cases that are used to assess the progress of the
project. These tests will stress the code performance, scalability, performance portability,
etc. These test cases are typically of a substantial size and therefore a separate
repository from which they can be checked out only when needed seems a reasonable 
approach.

Small tests associated with judging the code correctness, such as unit tests,
regression tests, etc., are kept in the source code repository. The rationale for that
is that users and developers who build the code from source should test whether it
built correctly in their environment.
